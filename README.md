# barista

This was our first group project

-The idea is to help baristas looking for coffee shops where they have the potential to make more money based on tiping ratio.   
-This app helps them by inserting the city where they are interested in working.   
-The results will have information like name of the coffe shop, address, phone #, and most importantly tip ratio.   
-Then they can the results of the coffee shops sorted by tipping ratio from highest to lowest.   
-From there they can click on the shops they are interested ikn and it will save a list for them to always revisit.
